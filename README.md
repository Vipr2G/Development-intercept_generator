# Development-intercept_generator
 Generates intercepts with parameters randomized around user provided seed values.
 
This was written using python 3.73 and has also run in 3.8.X

There are 3 files associated with the intercept_generator: intercept_generator.py parameter_generator.py intercept.json

intercept.json is edited by the user to configure the intercept_generator's run. Variables to pay attention to are in EMITTER.GENERAL if the intercept.json file and include: ELNOT number_of_intercepts output_file_name domain

Variables in the EMITTER.PARAMETERS section allow the user to configure the parametric values of the intercepts to be created. This is where the user will assign desired seed values to be randomized for the intecepts actual parameters. For example, under PRI the user sets: number_of_pris: (Not really used and should be cleaned up) modulation_type: (Currently set to STAGGER, and I do NO checking to see if the modType makes sense) distribution: (Currently set to normal) controls the type of randomize algorithm (Normal, Gaus...) tolerance: A bad variable name as I intened it to be "slop" around the given seed value, but in fact it changes depending on the distribution chosen. Example, if distrobution=NORMAL then tolerance is really "Sigma" where 2 would be 2 standard deviations. data: The actuall values to be used to seed the random number generator for the intercepts. In the example we will build 100 emitters, ALL with the same elnot, all having 10 pris randomly generated about 400.0, 450.0, 500.0 etc.

To execute the program, cd into the directory contaiing the 3 files and type: python intercept_generator

The output will be a json file named in the intercept.json file. Note that you will need to remove the last coma in the json file to have it properly formatted.

Note that I've commented out the last 3 lines. Put them back in to see a depiction of the randomizer at work in a histogram.

DEC:28 Notes: I've modified the intercept.json file to include 3 ELNOT (LND01, AIR01, SEA01) with various numbers of RFs and PRIs. Obviously you can add more, I just got tired of cut/past json objects! Currently configured to produce 5000 intercepts for each ELNOT. Ran in about 3 seconds. NOTE: You still have to remove the last coma in the output file, I'll get to it! NOTE: I've also put in histograms of the PRI/RF ... but think I'll move that functionallity to a Jupyter Notebook. Will enable user to view the intercept parametric deviations graphically to ensure the generated intercepts actually look like what you expected.

Edit 4/15/21
Added a GEO element to the intercept.json file which allows user to add center-point lat/lon, Ellipse orientation, and ellipse major axis length. Now during intercept generation, the generator will append a randomized geo associated with each intercept. In my example there are 3 centerpoints, 4 ellipse angles and 4 ellipse major lengths. this SHOULD allow clustering of ELNOT around 3 (In this case) seperate locations with various ellipses. To adjust the amount of variation, tweak the "Sigma" values in the generate_random_float_normal function call, currently set to 0.13 for lat/lon, 2 for major/minor ellipse length, and 0.3 for orientation. NOTE: Minor is generated from major and checked that it's value is less than major.
